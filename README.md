# Pacman-AI-agent

This was a project that I worked on for my Artifical Intelligence class. The goal of this project was to create a Pacman agent that would avoid the ghosts and collects as many pellets as it could. I used Python to complete this assignment. 

### What I learend
* Improved my Python skills
* Introduced me to AI agents by having me create my own Pacman agent
* Improved my thinking about algorithms and how to design one to complete its task
